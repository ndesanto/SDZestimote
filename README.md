# SDZ Estimote App Project

## Project Description

### Goal: Allow for visitor tracking on Ryerson Athletic Centre

We are attempting to use Estimote beacons and the associated SDK to track visitors as they use the various machines and areas in the weights room. This data will be used by Retail Management students consulting with the RAC to provide them with relevant insights that can used to enhance RAC services.
